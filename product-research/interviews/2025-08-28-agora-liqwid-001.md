## Context
Interview with the Liqwid Finance team: Kylix Afonso (Technical PM), Gedas Gardauskas (Engineer), and Dewayne Cameron (CEO). We spoke to them to understand the communication challenges of a major lending protocol (liquidation warnings, governance) and to validate the "Agora" solution. As a top DApp, their feedback on infrastructure, developer experience, and immediate needs (notifications vs. interactivity) is critical for MVP scoping.

## Raw notes
-   **Current State:** Discord (support), Discourse (governance), Twitter (announcements).
-   **Pain Points:**
    -   **Targeting:** Unable to reach specific users (e.g., "LQ token holders" or "users near liquidation").
    -   **Scams:** Telegram/Discord are "minefields" of scammers impersonating support.
    -   **Timeliness:** Users miss critical alerts (liquidations) because they don't live in their wallets 24/7.
-   **Protocol Feedback:**
    -   **Feature Request:** "Programmatic notifications" (e.g., trigger message if loan health < X%) handled by the infrastructure, not the DApp.
    -   **Onboarding:** Crucial requirement. Users must easily link wallets to "real world" channels (SMS, WhatsApp, Email) because they won't check a wallet inbox often.
    -   **Tech/Architecture:**
        -   **Blobs:** Strongly suggested using Cardano "Blobs" (L2 metadata plane) for message storage instead of building a new custom data layer.
        -   **DevEx:** Needs simple APIs and SDKs; don't "rate limit us to death."
    -   **Timeline/Scope:** Warned against scope creep (e.g., waiting for DIDs). Urged to deliver simple notification value *fast*.
-   **Mithril:** They use it for node syncing but found restore times slow, leading them to use custom snapshots.

## Key pains (human-curated)
-   **Inability to Target:** Cannot segment communication to specific groups (e.g., governance voters, at-risk borrowers); broadcast channels like Twitter are too noisy.
-   **Phishing Risk:** Reliance on public Discord/Telegram channels exposes users to sophisticated support scams, leading to fund loss.
-   **Missed Liquidations:** Users lose funds because they cannot receive urgent, "push" style notifications (SMS/Email) when their positions are volatile.
-   **Infrastructure Burden:** Building a compliant, secure notification system (GDPR, tracking positions) internally is a distraction from their core DeFi product.

## Jobs-to-be-done
-   **Prevent User Loss:** Urgently notify users when their loan positions are close to liquidation so they can take action.
-   **Mobilize Governance:** Alert token holders about active proposals and voting phases to increase DAO participation.
-   **Verify Authenticity:** Communicate with users through a channel where they can be 100% sure the message is actually from the Liqwid team.

## Candidate requirements
-   **REQ-001 – Web2 Bridge/Linkage:** The system MUST allow users to link their wallet address to "interruptive" channels like SMS, WhatsApp, or Email for urgent alerts.
-   **REQ-002 – "Blobs" Integration:** The protocol SHOULD investigate using Cardano Blobs for the data availability layer to avoid redundant infrastructure.
-   **REQ-003 – Programmatic Triggers:** (Future) The system SHOULD allow DApps to define logic (e.g., "if price drops 5%") that triggers messages automatically.
-   **REQ-004 – Rapid MVP Delivery:** The team MUST prioritize shipping basic notifications immediately rather than waiting for complex features like DIDs or interactivity.
-   **REQ-005 – Developer-Friendly Limits:** API rate limits MUST be generous enough to handle bursty traffic from high-volume DApps without service interruption.

## Gemini-normalised summary
- Persona: Liqwid Finance Team (CEO, Technical PM, Engineer) representing a high-volume lending protocol.
- Top 3 pains:
  - **Inability to Target:** We cannot segment communication to specific groups (e.g., governance voters, at-risk borrowers), forcing us to rely on noisy broadcast channels like Twitter.
  - **Missed Critical Alerts:** Users lose funds because they do not check wallet inboxes frequently enough to receive urgent liquidation warnings.
  - **Phishing & Trust Risks:** Reliance on public channels like Discord and Telegram exposes users to sophisticated support scams, making it hard to verify authentic team communication.
- JTBD:
  - **Prevent User Loss:** Urgently notify users via "interruptive" channels (SMS, Email) when loan positions are close to liquidation.
  - **Mobilize Governance:** Alert token holders about active proposals and voting phases to increase DAO participation.
  - **Verify Authenticity:** Establish a secure channel where users can be 100% certain messages originate from the official Liqwid team.
- Suggested requirements:
  - REQ-001 – Web2 Bridge/Linkage: System must allow linking wallet addresses to off-chain channels (SMS, WhatsApp, Email) for urgent alerts.
  - REQ-002 – "Blobs" Integration: Investigate using Cardano Blobs (L2 metadata) for message storage to reduce infrastructure overhead.
  - REQ-003 – Programmatic Triggers: Enable DApps to define logic (e.g., "loan health < X%") that triggers notifications automatically via the infrastructure.
  - REQ-004 – Rapid MVP Delivery: Prioritize basic notification value immediately over complex features like DIDs or heavy interactivity.
  - REQ-005 – Developer-Friendly Limits: API rate limits must be generous enough to accommodate the bursty traffic of a major lending protocol.
